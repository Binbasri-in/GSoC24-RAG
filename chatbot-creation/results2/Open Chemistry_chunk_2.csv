Implement new bridges,"There are outstanding issues on GitHub for more integrations with external programs (e.g. chemfiles, RDKit) via their Python bindings. There may also be more programs missing that haven't been considered.",Experience with Python and ideally familiarity with the program that is being bridged.,Medium,175 or 350 hours
Implement new methods,There are outstanding issues on GitHub for more analysis methods being added directly to cclib (e.g. calculating geometric parameters). There may also be other methods that are desirable to include which haven't been considered.,"Experience with Python and familiarity with the method(s) being added, depending on the complexity of the method.",Medium,350 hours
Additional visualization for OpenChemVault,"OpenChemVault (https://github.com/cclib/openchemvault) is capable of parsing output files, storing them, and displaying geometries, but any sort of additional visualization (such as plotting molecular orbitals or spectra) is missing. The capabilities of GaussSum (http://gausssum.sourceforge.net/) are a possible starting point.",Experience with Python common visualizations that are desirable for computational chemistry outputs. No previous experience with JavaScript is necessary.,Medium,350 hours
Integrate CoordGen library,Schrodinger has released a BSD-licensed library for 2D chemical structure layout (https://github.com/schrodinger/coordgenlibs) and it has been successfully integrated into RDKit. The student will be responsible for integrating CoordGen into Open Babel. Code will be written in C++.,Experience with C++,Easy,175 hours
Implement MMTF format,Implementation of MMTF file format in OpenBabel.,Experience with C++,Easy,90 hours
Test Framework Improvements,Automated testing is an important part of maintaining code quality. This project will improve the current testing regime of openbabel.,Experience in C++. Knowledge of modern software engineering practices or test frameworks is ideal.,Medium,90 or 175 hours
Develop a JavaScript or WebAssembly version of Open Babel,"Building on existing work, you will use Emscripten to compile the C++ codebase of Open Babel to JavaScript. This will make it easy to write in-browser applications that need cheminformatics functionality.","Some experience in C++, and also with JavaScript.",Hard,350 hours
Develop a validation and standardization filter,"Given a particular molecular structure, can we say how chemically plausible is it, and use this as to filter or warn about problems (e.g., undefined stereo centers)?",Experience in C++ and familiarity with chemical structures.,Hard,350 hours
