Summer project ideas 2024,"Below is a list of ideas for longer summer projects 2024 with sktime. For getting started or smaller projects, see our curated list of good first issues and advice on getting started as an sktime developer. The below list is only an ideas starter - we welcome and actively encourage bringing your own ideas to the table! For information on mentoring, summer programmes and application processes, see here for the newest information.","sklearn, methodology, probability, design/architecture",easy,90 hours
global forecasting and reduction forecasting,"Addition of global forecasting capability (with fit specific instances) to base class. Rework and extensions to direct, recursive forecasting. Flexible model specification interface for exogenous variables and features. Meta-strategies for global forecasting with fit specific instances. Integration of third party algorithms with global forecasting capability, e.g., pytorch-forecast.","statistical and ML approaches to forecasting, sklearn internals",medium,350 hours
"time-to-event modelling, probabilistic forecasting, probabilistic supervised learning","Help developing the skpro package - distributions, time-to-event models, reductions. Help implement estimators and compositors from the wishlists. Examples: model-based prediction intervals, probabilistic ensembles. Tuning, pipelines, composition.","methodology (forecasting), probability, sklearn internals",medium,175 or 350 hours
"bootstrapping, simulation & ensemble models","Develop modules for bootstrapping, simulation and probability objects, eg distributions over time series. Work towards integration with tsbootstrap package. Implement ensemble and tuning models based on bootstrap/simulation strategies.",methodology (probability),Medium,350 hours
categorical and time-constant features in forecasting,"Extend framework for full support of categorical features and time-constant features. Implement transformers and feature extractors, or interface 3rd party. Ensure pipelines, tuning, composites, hierarchical support work end-to-end.","sklearn and sklearn extensions with categorical features, framework/python",Medium,350 hours
annotation & segmentation,"Work with sktime core developers to design and create new module(s) for time series annotation. Annotation includes: segmentation, change point detection, outlier detection. Implementing base stock of estimators, interfacing popular specialist packages.","design/architecture, methodology (annotation)",hard,350 hours
