Google Summer of Code 2024,"This year, Oppia will be participating in Google Summer of Code 2024! GSoC is a global program which offers an opportunity to discover and work with open source organizations to post-secondary students and other non-experienced contributors. The contributions are supported by a stipend. Contributors work closely with one or more mentors from an open source organization in order to implement either a project idea by the organization, or a proposal of their own. In order to receive updates about GSoC at Oppia, please subscribe to the Oppia GSoC Announce mailing list. This year, Oppia will follow the standard GSoC timeline: projects will have 6 weeks for each milestone, with a product demo and internal evaluation after 5 weeks. Please refer to the Dates and Deadlines section below for more details. Also, please note that acceptance into GSoC isn't a prerequisite for becoming an Oppia contributor. The Oppia project is run by the community for the community, and we warmly welcome anyone who'd like to help out!
