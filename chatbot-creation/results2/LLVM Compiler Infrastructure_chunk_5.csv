Machine Learning Guided Ordering of Compiler Optimization Passes,This project aims to improve the existing heuristics or replace them with machine learning-based models for a superior order of optimization passes customized per application. Expected outcomes include a pre-trained model for selecting the most economical optimization pipeline and hooking up the model in LLVM.,"C/C++, compiler experience, ML experience",Medium,175 or 350 hours
Learning Loop Transformation Policies,Continuation of last year's project to replace policy decisions with machine-learned ones for loop unrolling. Expected outcomes include a policy interface for loop unrolling and setting up feature extraction for reinforcement learning training.,"C/C++, compiler experience, ML experience",Medium/Hard,175 or 350 hours
Evaluate and Expand the Module-Level Inliner,Focuses on evaluating alternative traversal orders and clustering inlining decisions. Expected outcomes include proposals for alternative traversal orders and evaluation of inlining effectiveness/frequency of function optimization passes after inlining.,"C/C++, compiler experience",Medium/Hard,175 or 350 hours
Richer symbol dependency information for LTO,"Improving LLVM's LTO implementation with respect to linker GC to optimize symbol resolution. Expected outcomes include modifications to the C++ LTO interface, LTO usage of new symbol reference information, and modification of LLD for ELF.","Intermediate C++, linker concepts",Medium/Hard,350 hours
Remove undef: move uninitialized memory to poison,"Focuses on removing the undef value in LLVM by moving all uses to poison. Expected outcomes include devising a consistent semantics for uninitialized memory, upgrading LLVM, implementing changes in LLVM and clang, and benchmarking for regressions or performance improvements.",Intermediate C++,Medium/Hard,350 hours
Add API/ABI export annotations to the LLVM build,A project to change the default visibility of library symbols to 'hidden' and add an annotation macro to LLVM. Expected outcomes include implementing the export macro and porting at least one internal target to the new export scheme.,"Build systems, CMake, LLVM",Easy,Medium
Extend clang AST to provide information for the type as written in template instantiations,A project to preserve type sugar when accessing members of a template specialization in Clang. Expected outcomes include diagnostics preserving type sugar and re-sugaring the type when accessing members of a template specialization.,"Good knowledge of clang API, C++, clang's AST",Large,N/A
Implement support for C++17 structured bindings in the Clang Static Analyzer,Enhancing the Static Analyzer to correctly model structured binding and decomposition declarations in C++17. Expected outcomes include structured bindings no longer appearing uninitialized to the Static Analyzer's uninitialized variable checker.,"Intermediate C++, Clang AST, static analysis",Medium/Hard,350 hours
Improve Clang Diagnostics,"A project to survey and identify possible improvements to Clang diagnostics. Expected outcomes include improving diagnostic aesthetics, covering missing diagnostics, reducing false positive rates, and rewording diagnostics.",N/A,N/A,N/A
