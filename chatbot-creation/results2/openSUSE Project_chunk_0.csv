openSUSE 101,"The openSUSE Project believes in fostering long-term relationships between mentors and mentees that extend well beyond the Google Summer of Code program. We encourage continuous mentorship with the aim to nurture development in the open-source software community and support sustained learning and growth. Potential mentees can view the description of these projects headlines list on 101.opensuse.org and contact the organization’s mentors through the “More Details” link, which goes to an issue on GitHub if they have questions or need more information regarding a project. Commenting on the issue will put mentees in direct contact with mentors for each project. This will help mentees when writing their proposals to participate in Google Summer of Code.","Mentorship, Open-source software development, Google Summer of Code",Medium,Long

Kanidm,"Kanidm is an Identity Management system - it stores the information for people, accounts, systems, and groups, to allow authentication and security decisions to be made for infrastructure. This can range from website single sign-on, to wifi authentication, to ssh on Linux servers. Due to the nature of Identity Management, the system must span a broad range of topics. From web user interfaces and human interaction, social and cultural research to ensure we respect all identities we store, to security and hardening to prevent exploits, and high-performance systems to support thousands of operations per second. There is a new challenge for everyone within the project!","Rust, Identity Management, Security, Databases",High,Long
