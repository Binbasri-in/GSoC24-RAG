Slips # 1 : ML Detection,"It is necessary to plan and design an anomaly detection schema that would use DNS, TLS, HTTP, ASN, and the time of the requests. Then, it is necessary to combine them in a multi-modal system. This task requires good training/testing before deploying. Additionally, it should also allow the users to retrain with their own traffic (like now with the MLflow module).","Machine learning experience, Python, communication, a basic understanding of networking data.",Medium,12 weeks
Slips # 2 Better Installation,"Slips has grown into a sizable project with many dependencies, including libraries and tools such as Zeek and tensorflow framework. Due to its complexity, it is currently not easy for users to install Slips. This project involves analyzing Slips and determining the best way to publish it to a known package management system.","Snapcraft or Debian packaging, communication",Medium,8 weeks
Slips # 3 Slips Global P2P Threat Intelligence,"We already designed a complex global P2P system and trust model for Slips. This project involves first implementing the servers and infrastructure for the global P2P network in the world. Second, implementing both systems inside Slips so it can use the global P2P system for sharing TI. Iris is the Global P2P system. And Fides is the global trust model.","Python, Communication",Hard,16 weeks
Slips # 4 Codebase Enhancement through Unit Testing,Identify core functionality and add unit testing to make the codebase more robust and improve existing unit tests.,"Python, Unit Testing, CI/CD",Easy,6 weeks
AI VPN # 1 CLI Management Console with Textual,"We want to design and implement a new management CLI that allows admins to check the status of the AI VPN: users provisioned, ongoing activity, be able to provision and expire profiles, etc. We want this CLI to be developed using Textual. The data of the modules is stored in Redis, and there are already some functions implemented to retrieve that data.","Python, UI, Communication",Medium,10 weeks
AI VPN # 2 Codebase Enhancement through Unit Testing,"The objective is to strengthen the AI VPN codebase, ensuring it is more robust and resilient. We want this to help enhance the CI/CD process to make the process of integrating community contributions better. This project consists of designing and prioritizing the implementation of comprehensive Unit Tests throughout the codebase, improving its test coverage.","Python, Unit Testing, CI/CD",Medium,8 weeks
AI VPN # 3 Improve the AI VPN report of results,"The current AI VPN report has a lot of room for improvement. We want to discuss, design, evaluate, and implement how to do this better. Specifically, we want to communicate the results better and show the value of the AI VPN framework.","UI, bash, web design (would be nice), communication",Hard,14 weeks
AI VPN # 4 System Audit and Internal Report,"Most features of the AI VPN focus on the clients, however, the administrators of the AI VPN also need to know and report the usage of the tool. How much is it used? How much traffic? How many incidents? Etc. This task involves putting yourself in the role of the admin, developing a report generator that would gather all sorts of valuable metrics, and creating a report that can be read and shared by the admin with interested stakeholders.","Python, Communication, Redis, UI",Hard,12 weeks
