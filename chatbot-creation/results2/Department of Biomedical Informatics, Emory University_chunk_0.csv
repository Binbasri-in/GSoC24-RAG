Development of an Open-Source EEG Foundation Model,"A foundation model refers to a large-scale model that is pre-trained on extensive, often unlabeled data, capturing a broad understanding of that data. This project aims to create an open-source foundation model for EEG data analysis. It will involve developing algorithms for EEG signal processing, automatic feature extraction, and implementing deep learning-based algorithms for pre-training a foundation model on publicly available EEG datasets.","Strong programming skills, preferably in Python. Experience with deep learning frameworks, preferably PyTorch. Knowledge of self-supervised learning and large language models. Knowledge in signal processing, neuroscience, or related fields.",Hard,350 Hours
Health-AI Ethics Atlas,"This project aims to develop an interactive global map that visualizes the application and development of ethical principles in medical AI across different countries. It will highlight the diversity in ethical standards, regulatory approaches, and implementation practices in healthcare AI worldwide.","Proficiency in web development (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Experience with data visualization tools and libraries (e.g., D3.js, Leaflet). Understanding of GIS and mapping software. Knowledge in data analysis and handling large datasets. Interest or background in AI ethics, particularly in healthcare.",Medium,350 Hours
Python Expansion of the Open Source Electrophysiological Toolbox,"The project aims to continue the Python expansion of OSET to convert it into a standard Python package, broadening access and maintaining consistency across platforms. The planned upgrades include comprehensive cross-language unit tests (between MATLAB and Python), documentation, example codes, installation, and maintenance mechanisms, with a modern software-engineered architecture and objective microbenchmarks.",Proficiency in Python and MATLAB. A background in signal processing. Experience in biomedical signal processing.,Medium,350 Hours
A Framework for Unsupervised Deep Clustering,The objective of this project is to develop an open-source framework that utilizes unsupervised deep-learning techniques for data clustering. The framework should be capable of handling low-resource scenarios and be able to scale to large datasets.,Python and deep learning,Hard,350 Hours
