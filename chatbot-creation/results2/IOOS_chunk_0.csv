Echopype,"Echopype is a package built to enable interoperability and scalability in ocean sonar data processing. These data are widely used for obtaining information about the distribution and abundance of marine animals, such as fish and krill.",ioos/gsoc #41,Intermediate,175 hours
Kerchunk API for GRIB data,"Kerchunk is a library that provides a unified way to represent a variety of chunked, compressed data formats (e.g. NetCDF/HDF5, GRIB2, TIFF, â€¦), allowing efficient access to the data from traditional file systems or cloud object storage. It also provides a flexible way to create virtual datasets from multiple files.",ioos/gsoc #42,Intermediate,175 hours
Gliderpy,"Gliderpy is a thin wrapper around erddapy with custom methods and plotting functionality to browse, fetch, and plot glider data.",ioos/gsoc #43,Intermediate,175 hours
ERDDAP: protected datasets API,"ERDDAP is a scientific data server that gives users a simple, consistent way to download subsets of gridded and tabular scientific datasets in common file formats and make graphs and maps. ERDDAP has been installed by approximately 100 organizations in at least 17 countries.",ioos/gsoc #44,Intermediate,175 hours
ERDDAP: enhancements for ERDDAP administrators,"ERDDAP is a scientific data server that gives users a simple, consistent way to download subsets of gridded and tabular scientific datasets in common file formats and make graphs and maps. ERDDAP has been installed by approximately 100 organizations in at least 17 countries.",ioos/gsoc #45,Intermediate,175 hours
ioos_qc: QA/QC for glider data,"ioos_qc is the canonical implementation of the QARTOD manuals for ocean QA/QC best practices. This project ideas are to: create QA/QC examples, write documentation for its use, and implement missing QA/QC checks for glider data",ioos/gsoc #45,Advanced,350 hours
OCSMesh improvement,OCSMesh is a Python package for processing DEM data into georeferenced unstructured meshes using the jigsaw-python library.,ioos/gsoc #58,Intermediate,175 hours
Searvey improvement,"Searvey aims to provide the following functionality: Unified catalogue of observational data including near real time (WIP), Real time data analysis/clean up to facilitate comparison with numerical models (WIP), On demand data retrieval from multiple sources",ioos/gsoc #59,Intermediate,175 hours
Model subsetting tool,"This project enhances preliminary code for subsetting large unstructured-grid numerical model outputs on cloud platforms, making forecast data more accessible through widely used open-source Python libraries.",ioos/gsoc #57,Intermediate,175 hours
