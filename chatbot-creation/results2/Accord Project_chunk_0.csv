Playground and Getting Started Experience,"Make major improvements to the existing Accord Project Playground to provide a best-in-class web experience to learn and experiment with Accord Project technology. This work should take design and implementation inspiration from similar efforts for other leading programming languages, such as TypeScript and its use of TwoSlash for runnable code examples. The project should also consider how the existing Accord Project documentation, as well as the Concerto documentation is integrated into an overall learning pathway and tutorial experience.","TypeScript, React, Information Design/Architecture",Medium,350 hours
Model Creation AI Assistant (Co-Pilot),"Assist users creating Concerto models using an in-context AI assistant (co-pilot). Design a user experience and support multiple foundational AI models, for example: OpenAI, Bard, Anthropic etc. Develop the required LLM prompts and measure their effectiveness. Ensure users understand the data they are sharing and opt-in to AI assistance. Review similar efforts from across the industry, e.g. GitHub, Repl.it, Google, and others.","TypeScript, Basic Knowledge of ChatGPT, or similar",Medium,175 hours
Import Aliasing,"Concerto language supports reusing of terms defined in other model definition files through imports. We can import a single or multiple terms. However, imported or defined, a term can only exist once in a model file. If we can alias an import then we can free ourselves from this limitation, in case we either already have a term with the same name in the model file or we want to use two terms that share the same name that are imported.","Familiarity with Parser Expression Grammars, Code Generation, JavaScript",Medium,175 hours
Rust Validator for Concerto,"Re-implement the current Concerto Validator in Rust so that it can be consumed from multiple languages (using FFI, WASM, etc.). The reimplementation should replicate the existing behaviour of the current JavaScript validator. This should provide improvements in performance, reliability and portability","Rust, Algorithms, Functional programming, Back end development, Rust API design",Hard,350 hours
Linter for Concerto,Write a linter in TypeScript for Concerto Source files. It should make use of existing functionality to validate the Concerto DSL syntax and JSON AST of Concerto model against a set of rules. Rules should be defined in Typescript and which rules are run should be configurable.,"Algorithms, Functional programming, Back end development, NodeJS, TypeScript",Hard,350 hours
