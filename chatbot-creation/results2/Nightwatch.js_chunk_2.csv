"Add the ability to allow users to update the various Android SDK tools required to run Android Emulator, by giving them a list of all the tools that can be updated (along with their current version and latest versions), and an option to update all the SDK tools in one go.","Add the ability to connect Android devices to adb wirelessly by running command npx @ nightwatch/mobile-helper android -- connect -- wireless, which would allow users to automate Android devices wirelessly: https://developer.android.com/tools/adb#wireless-android11-command-line","Skills Required: TypeScript, Node.js, Android SDKs",Medium,350 hours
Integrate WebDriver BiDi in Nightwatch.js,"Make the required changes in Nightwatch.js so that it can work with the new WebDriver BiDi protocol alongside the WebDriver API protocol. Migrate the existing CDP (Chrome Devtools Protocol) based commands to use the new browser-agnostic WebDriver BiDi Protocol, which will make those commands work on non-Chromium based browsers as well. Implement new functionalities using WebDriver BiDi Protocol like Script Pinning, DOM Mutation Observer, etc. Make sure the existing Nightwatch.js APIs continue to work as expected after transitioning to WebDriver BiDi protocol, and in case of any discrepancies, report the same to the Selenium project. Update API documentations accordingly.","Skills Required: JavaScript, Node.js, Selenium, WebSockets",Medium,350 hours
Improve Nightwatch v3 Element API,"Add a few missing capabilities (commands) to Nightwatch v3 Element API: nightwatchjs/nightwatch#3901. Make action commands on the new Element API chainable, which will further improve the test writing experience for users. For example, we should be able to chain .click() and .sendKeys() command as: browser.element.find().click().sendKeys(). Make sure that the action commands throw error in case an error is returned by Selenium: nightwatchjs/nightwatch#3899. Add a force parameter on the .click() command to force click on an element in case the normal click does not work. Add improvements to Testing Library.findByRole() command: nightwatchjs/nightwatch#3887. Update Nightwatch example tests to use the new Element API syntax. Add new example tests that show the usage of all the commands/assertions available with the new Element API. This will not only serve as a direct reference for the users to check how to use a command, but will also serve as a regression test suite for Nightwatch.js that we can run regularly to make sure we are not breaking anything in subsequent releases.","Skills Required: JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js",Easy/Medium,350 hours
