Real-time BGP monitor,"Network operators need to monitor the global reachability of their IP prefixes
every time they update their routing policies , RPKI , or BGP announcements.
The goal of this project is to provide a monitoring dashboard on the IHR website
to easily monitor how a prefix propagates on the Internet . This tool should get
a prefix ( or list of prefixes or an ASN ) from a user , optionnally the user can
select a list of RIS collectors and the maximum number of hops from the monitored
prefix to display . Then the user push a 'play ' button . The tool connects to
RIS Live with the corresponding parameters and displays the AS paths received.
It could be similar to BGPlay but we 'd like to
show only nodes that are near the monitored prefix so the graphs are more readable.
A path should be replaced if a new path is advertised by the same peer.
We also would like to show line charts to reflect the changes over time.","Basics of BGP , Javascript , VueJS , D3JS or other plotting library",Medium,175 hours
IYP automatic deployment,"For the Internet Yellow Pages we compute every week a new
database that we want to make publicly available as soon as possible . The goal
of this project is to design and implement this automated deployment . This
requires multiple tests that will ensure the integrity of the new database , 
automatically store the new database on a public repository , and hot swap databases.
Optionally we could keep older databases online , for example all databases for the
past month.","Neo4j , python , docker",Easy/Medium,175 hours
Network topology overview,"IHR monitors the inter-dependence of networks ( e.g . the
university of Tokyo relies on Japan 's academic ISP ) and displays these
dependencies with very simple line charts that highlights changes over time.
Representing this data as a graph is more intuitive for network operators.
So the goal of this project is to show the connectivity of a network ( aka AS ) in
a simple graph.
Using data from the Internet Yellow Pages we can depict a very detailed view of
an AS , by finding all prefixes originated by the AS , fetching AS dependencies for
all these prefixes , grouping these prefixes based on their dependencies , and
finally displaying an AS graph that shows how these prefixes are connected to the
Internet . Additional information for each AS/prefix can be displayed by querying
IYP.
Related to this project , we have an offline tool that shows network dependencies
for a country , this is also something we 'd like to implement on IHR website
 ( https : //github.com/InternetHealthReport/country-as-hegemony-viz ) .","Basics of BGP , Javascript , VueJS , and visualization library ( i.e . Plotly or D3.js )",Medium,175 hours or 350 hours
