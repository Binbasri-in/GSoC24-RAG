Add support for memory compression,Support compression for page images. This task does not require any Linux kernel modifications and scope is limited to CRIU itself.,Skill level: intermediate,Difficulty: intermediate,Duration: 350 hours
Add support for checkpoint/restore of CORK-ed UDP socket,"Support C/R of corked UDP socket. Currently criu refuses to dump this case, so it's effectively a bug. Supporting this will need extending the kernel API to allow criu read back the write queue of the socket.",Skill level: intermediate (+linux kernel),Difficulty: intermediate,Duration: 350 hours
Add support for pidfd file descriptors,Support C/R of pidfd descriptors. At the moment CRIU can't dump processes that have pidfd's opened.,Skill level: intermediate,Difficulty: intermediate,Duration: 350 hours
Use eBPF to lock and unlock the network,Use eBPF instead of external iptables-restore tool for network lock and unlock. Currently CRIU calls out to iptables-restore to create and delete the corresponding iptables rules.,Skill level: intermediate,Difficulty: intermediate,Duration: 350 hours
Files on detached mounts,"Initial support of open files on 'detached' mounts. When criu dumps a process with an open fd on a file, it gets the mount identifier (mnt_id) via /proc/<pid>/fdinfo/<fd>, so that criu knows from which exact mount the file was initially opened.",Skill level: intermediate,Difficulty: intermediate,Duration: 350 hours
Checkpointing of POSIX message queues,"Add support for checkpoint/restore of POSIX message queues. Message queues are implemented as files on a virtual filesystem (mqueue), where a file descriptor (message queue descriptor) is used to perform operations such as sending or receiving messages.",Skill level: intermediate,Difficulty: intermediate,Duration: 350 hours
Kubernetes operator for managing container checkpoints,Develop a Kubernetes operator that automates the management of container checkpoints. Container checkpointing has recently been introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes.,Skill level: intermediate,Difficulty: intermediate,Duration: 350 hours
Optimize logging engine,"CRIU puts a lots of logs when doing its job. Logging is done with simple fprintf function. If comparing criu dump with and without logs the time difference is notable (15%-20%), so speeding the logs up will help improve criu performance.",Skill level: intermediate,Difficulty: intermediate,Duration: 350 hours
IOUring support,"The io_uring Asynchronous I/O (AIO) framework is a new Linux I/O interface, first introduced in upstream Linux kernel version 5.1 (March 2019). It provides a low-latency and feature-rich interface for applications that require AIO functionality.",Skill level: expert (+linux kernel),Difficulty: expert,Duration: 350 hours
Add support for SPFS,The SPFS is a special filesystem that allows checkpoint and restore of such things as NFS and FUSE. The important part of it is the need to implement the integration of Stub-Proxy File System (SPFS) with LXC/yet_another_containers_environment.,Skill level: expert,Difficulty: expert,Duration: 350 hours
Anonymise image files,"Teach CRIT to remove sensitive information from images. When reporting a BUG it may be not acceptable for the reporter to send us raw images, as they may contain sensitive data.",Skill level: beginner,Difficulty: beginner,Duration: N/A
