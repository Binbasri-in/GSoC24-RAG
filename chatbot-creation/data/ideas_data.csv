Move existing tests to a unit testing framework,"Git has a lot of test cases that need to be migrated to use a new unit testing framework. This typically involves moving code from both: a “t/helper/test-* .c” test helper in C, and a “t/*.sh” test script in shell that invokes the test helper over to a single “t/unit-tests/t-* .c” in C using the unit testing framework. Our Outreachy intern ported some of the unit tests. Note: Owing to additional care needed to convert reftable unit tests in t0032-reftable-unittest.sh, it is covered as a separate project below. So, this project solely focuses on unit tests other than the reftable ones.

Convert reftable unit tests to use the unit testing framework,The “reftable” unit tests in t0032-reftable-unittest.sh predate the unit testing framework that was recently introduced into Git. These tests should be converted to use the new framework. See: this discussion https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1692297001.git.steadmon@google.com/ https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/unit-tests.txt https://git-scm.com/docs/reftable,"['C', ' shell (bash)']",Low,175 hours or 350 hours,Git,https://git.github.io/SoC-2024-Ideas/,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/git/mbqqznjbaohwgq80-360.png,22
Implement consistency checks for refs,"The git-fsck(1) command is used to check various data structures for consistency. Notably missing though are consistency checks for the refdb. While git-fsck(1) implicitly checks some of the properties of the refdb because it uses its refs for a connectivity check, these checks aren’t sufficient to properly ensure that all refs are properly consistent. The goal of this project would be to introduce consistency checks that can be implemented by the ref backend. Initially these checks may only apply to the “files” backend. With the ongoing efforts to upstream a new “reftable” backend the effort may be extended. See: https://lore.kernel.org/git/6cfee0e4-3285-4f18-91ff-d097da9de737@rd10.de/ https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1706601199.git.ps@pks.im/ https://git-scm.com/docs/reftable","['C', ' shell (bash)']",Medium,175 hours or 350 hours,Git,https://git.github.io/SoC-2024-Ideas/,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/git/mbqqznjbaohwgq80-360.png,22
Refactor git-bisect(1) to make its state self-contained,"The git-bisect(1) command is used to find a commit in a range of commits that introduced a specific bug. Starting a bisection run creates a set of state files into the Git repository which record various different parameters like “.git/BISECT_START”. These files look almost like refs due to their names being all-uppercase. This has led to confusion with the new “reftable” backend because it wasn’t quite clear whether those files are in fact refs or not. As it turns out they are not refs and should never be treated like one. Overall, it has been concluded that the way those files are currently stored is not ideal. Instead of having a proliferation of files in the Git directory, it was discussed whether the bisect state should be moved into its own “bisect-state” subdirectory. This would make it more self-contained and thereby avoid future confusion. It is also aligned with the sequencer state used by rebases, which is neatly contained in the “rebase-apply” and “rebase-merge” directories. The goal of this project would be to realize this change. While rearchitecting the layout should be comparatively easy to do, the harder part will be to hash out how to handle backwards compatibility.

Implement support for reftables in “dumb” HTTP transport,"Fetching Git repositories uses one of two major protocols: The “dumb” protocol works without requiring any kind of interactive negotiation like a CGI module. It can thus be served by a static web server. The “smart” protocol works by having the client and server exchange multiple messages with each other. It is more efficient, but requires support for Git in the server. While almost all servers nowadays use the “smart” protocol, there are still some that use the “dumb” protocol. The “dumb” protocol cannot serve repositories which use the “reftable” backend though. While there exists an “info/refs” file that is supposed to be backend-agnostic, this file does not contain information about the default branch. Instead, clients are expected to download the “HEAD” file and derive the default branch like that. This file is a mere stub in the “reftable” backend though, which breaks this protocol. The goal of this project is to implement “reftable” support for “dumb” fetches.

NNCF Quantization Analytics Tool,"Quantization, a widely adopted technique for reducing model size and accelerating model inference, often leads to a slight decrease in accuracy compared to the original floating-point model. However, in some cases, quantization can introduce significant performance degradation. Identifying the root cause of these accuracy drops can be a difficult task, and often even more challenging than fixing it. In this project, we will develop an analytic tool for analyzing quantization errors in the quantized models using NNCF. We will provide a user-friendly interface for inspecting quantization errors, calculating statistics and metrics such as MSE, and SQNR to identify the layers with the most significant errors, and visualizing them together with the model in Netron.

Prototype for JAX/Flax Models Support (or Mindspore),"Flax/JAX is a new solution for training models, that provides much faster training than TensorFlow and PyTorch. So we should expect increase in amount of Flax/Jax models. However, OpenVINO currently supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, PDPD models but it lacks of native support for JAX models. Not all JAX models can be exported to TensorFlow SavedModel format. So there exists of a problem for native and direct support for JAX models without intermediate format usage. The implemented functionality should include logic for parsing traced JAX objects, translators for conversion basic JAX operations into OpenVINO opset decompositions. The functionality should be relied and inherit common FE API so that it will be possible to convert JAX models using ovc.convert_model. The feature should be extendable in the future by others (OV team and open-source community) to support new JAX operations and models. The goal is to implement a prototype with basic functionality to support fundamental models (ResNet, BERT) trained with JAX.

AnomalyGPT: Integrating Vision Language Models (VLMs) in Anomalib for zero- and few-shot anomaly detection,"The goal of this project is to integrate the capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs) within the anomalib framework. Anomalib is a deep learning library designed for anomaly detection research. VLMs could be used for anomaly detection purposes by prompting the VLM to determine if an image contains an anomaly or not. An advantage of this approach over classical anomaly detection techniques is that a VLM can explain its decision in natural language, which benefits the interpretability of the predictions. The first part of the project consists of creating a coupling between Anomalib and OpenAI’s ChatGPT API. The student will use the ChatGPT UI to create a custom GPT that is instructed to detect anomalies in images using ChatGPT’s internal VLM. On the Anomalib side, the student will create a model wrapper that interacts with the GPT through API calls so that the GPT’s predictions can be used within the Anomalib framework. Design choices will need to be made around parsing the responses of the GPT and presenting the predictions to the user. The student will conduct a series of experiments to investigate how the performance of the GPT compares to other Anomalib models on structural and logical anomaly detection datasets such as MVTec AD and MVTec LOCO. Optional extensions of the project include replacing the ChatGPT model with a locally deployed open-source VLM such as LLaVa, and implementing a simple UI that allows a discourse-style interaction with the model.","['Proficient in Python', ' Familiar with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch Lightning', ' Understanding of anomaly detection principles', ' Experience with anomalib']",Medium to hard,350 hours,OpenVINO Toolkit,https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/wiki/Google-Summer-Of-Code,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/openvino-toolkit/ivzvok335ujezk2z-360.png,9
Synthetic Anomaly Generation for Threshold Selection and Model Evaluation in Anomalib,"Anomalib is a Python library designed to facilitate visual anomaly detection research, where the task is to identify anomalous, or abnormal images in a dataset. While Anomalib’s models only need normal images during training, some examples of anomalous images are still needed in the validation and testing stages for threshold selection and model evaluation. In real-world use-cases however, anomalous samples may not be available at training time, preventing accurate computation of these metrics. The purpose of this project is to create a synthetic anomaly generation module within Anomalib that will allow researchers to generate a wide variety of synthetic anomalies for the purpose of selecting appropriate thresholds and evaluating anomaly detection models. The project will involve the development of algorithms that can introduce anomalies into normal datasets in a controllable and scalable manner. These synthetic anomalies may range from simple, like noise injection, to complex, like generating contextually out-of-place objects using advanced generative models such as diffusion models.","['Proficiency in Python', ' Experience with deep learning libraries such as PyTorch Lightning', ' Understanding of machine/deep learning', ' Basic understanding of generative models', ' Understanding of anomaly detection principles', ' Experience with anomalib']",Hard,350 hours,OpenVINO Toolkit,https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/wiki/Google-Summer-Of-Code,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/openvino-toolkit/ivzvok335ujezk2z-360.png,9
Extending OpenVINO's llama.cpp community plugin for configurable GGML inferencing backend,"We are currently preparing a community plugin for OpenVINO inference that would take specially prepared IR models known to correspond to llama.cpp-supported architectures, parse them for weights and other GGML-required parameters and defer actual inference to the llama.cpp/GGML executors. The initial version of the plugin will only be limited to standard GGML inference without HW-specific acceleration. Since in its current state the llama.cpp/GGML executors already support HW-accelerated inference as well (via CUDA, and more recently, SYCL), the natural extension of this approach would be to make the community plugin accept options pertaining to the actual GGML backend selection. In this fashion a user flow would be enabled that would allow the developers to execute certain IR-format models with llama.cpp/GGML instead of regular OpenVINO plugins, while still using the familiar OpenVINO APIs such as ov::Model and ov::InferRequest, since the dispatching of the loads to the llama.cpp/GGML would be abstracted under the OpenVINO plugin system and the implementation of the future plugin.","['C/C++', ' GTest', ' OpenVINO API', ' Github Actions']",Medium,175 hours,OpenVINO Toolkit,https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/wiki/Google-Summer-Of-Code,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/openvino-toolkit/ivzvok335ujezk2z-360.png,9

Support for the new reconciliation protocol,"The reconciliation feature in OpenRefine relies on a unified protocol , which is used to communicate with various web services offering data matching functionalities for various data sources . The W3C Entity Reconciliation Community Group has been working on a new version of this protocol , addressing a number of problems in the current one . For instance , it is currently very cumbersome to reconcile entities in OpenRefine when one does not have a column with names of those entities , because the existing protocol assumes that those names must always be provided ( # 6044 ) . We would like to add support for the new protocol to address this issue , and various others ( see below ) . We would like to maintain support for the existing protocol , so that existing reconciliation services continue to work . As we do this work , we might be able to bring up issues to the W3C group , so that the new specifications can be improved accordingly . This might be a good opportunity to clean up our current reconciliation code so that it bases itself on an external library instead .",['JavaScript & Java'],Intermediate,350h,OpenRefine,https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GSoC-Outreachy-2024-Ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/openrefine-j0/vygefztjlapanqqa-360.png,4
Better testing utilities for extension development,"OpenRefine 's functionality can be augmented via extensions . However , developing extensions outside of OpenRefine 's code base is not so easy , in particular regarding debugging and testing . Our sample extension is included in OpenRefine 's repository , making it of little use to demonstrate how to develop an extension as a third-party . The goal of this project would be to improve this by : develop a workflow to run OpenRefine with the Java debugger enabled , to debug an extension via commonly-used IDEs ( IntelliJ IDEA , Eclipse , VSCode ) . This would help developers interactively develop their extension in its actual execution environment . develop utilities to run Cypress tests on an extension . The utility should download a specific version of OpenRefine and run it on a test workspace that contains the extension to test . This could then be used to run Cypress tests against the extension . provide a `` model '' extension , developed outside of OpenRefine 's repository , following the best practices ( Java and Cypress tests , CI , only using clearly documented extension points ) , that people can take inspiration from . As an example extension , we could either revamp an existing extension ( such as the Commons extension ) or create a new one . We have a page with some ideas for new extensions . ideally , clean up the existing documentation , making sure it is up to date and provides all the necessary information . We may take inspiration from external resources written on this subject , such as Giuliano Tortoreto 's guide or Owen Stephen 's blog post .","['Java', ' Cypress', ' CI/CD']",Intermediate,350h,OpenRefine,https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GSoC-Outreachy-2024-Ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/openrefine-j0/vygefztjlapanqqa-360.png,4

Nix currently special-cases some environment variables in derivations to convey extra meaning ( ""system features"", ""prefer local build"", etc.) .
We're stuck with this in the .drv A-Term format and builtins.derivation because of backwards compatibility requirements, but that doesn't mean our internal data structures and (currently experimental, i.e. not yet stabilized and immobile) JSON format cannot be improved.
This project would be about doing just that: Fix the internal data structures, and then use that refactor to make the JSON format better.
As a stretch goal, we can then start proposing/prototyping a worthy successor to builtins.derivation that would better support this stuff.
(C.f. the ""structured attrs"" work in Nixpkgs.)

nixpkgs library networking functions
Many things in NixOS use the Internet Protocol and other network related technologies, thus a lot of modules and service have to deal with them.
Currently this is mostly done just passing strings as arguments, but it would be a lot more convenient to have things like lib.types.ipv6, lib.types.ipv4 and other functions to for example convert between cidr notation and the bit representation of netmasks.
Some inspiration for functions can be drawn from similar libraries like the python ipaddress lib
This would not just be useful for NixOS itself but also for its users since a lot of folks use it to power network appliances and build infrastructure on top of it.
Skills required/preferred :
Some prior networking knowledge would be useful but is not required. Prior knowledge of the nix programming language is not required, any new-comer wanting to pick this up should easily be able to complete a nix tutorial like a tour of Nix in one or two afternoons and be good to go.

ideas,"First class support for Crystal applications
Currently, our support for applications written in crystal consists of 2 main pieces :

crystal2nix for converting lock files created by the shards tool to nix.
the nixpkgs build infrastructure that supports a range of different means to build crystal applications (incl consuming the outputs of item 1).

The existing support is brittle and unpleasant to read and only supports dependencies fetched via git.
This project would be interesting as it touches several different types of projects :

redesigning the build infrastructure to be easier to hack on (nixpkgs)
implementing the new build infrastructure (nixpkgs)
extending the crystal2nix tool to understand other VCSs (crystal2nix)

A systemd service supports triggering another unit if it fails through the OnFailure option. In NixOS we have centralized configuration and yet no way to easily opt in to common/shared OnFailure handlers.

README.md,"Nix Internals : Use std::filesystem::path for Path
Nix currently has a bunch of home-grown file system and file path utilities.
However in recent years (C++17) the standard library has gained a new std::filesystem library which has much of the same functionality.
The purpose of this project is to use std::filesystem where possible, with a particular emphasis on using the std::filesystem::path type rather than our own Path (which is just an alias for std::string).
This shrinks Nix (no need to maintain redundant code!) and will also aid in porting Nix to Windows, since an explicit design goal of std::filesystem is to be portable between Unix and Windows.

nixpkgs pnpm tooling
pnpm is a package manager that claims to be up to 2x faster than npm and more efficient than npm when it comes to disk space usage, because of this benefits more and more projects are using pnpm.
We have tooling for the npm but it's mostly incompatible, this is leading to hacky workarounds and makes packaging pnpm projects a pain.
If you decide to work on this project you will gain a lot of knowledge about the gears that make nixpkgs turn, namely things like setup hooks and fetcher.

Having experience with javascript/frontend tooling like nodejs would most certainly be a plus.

contributor-guide.md,"outpath cache for faster automation
OfBorg and nixpkgs-update rely on a tool that calculates the output directories for every derivation in the top level of nixpkgs. The tool is run before and after a change to detect how many packages will be affected by the change. It is currently very slow. In fact, it is probably about 80% of the total computation nixpkgs-update does. This project would be to cache information about what kind of edits affect other derivations, or statically determine it in a faster way than calculating the outpath of every derivation. A successful project would speed up OfBorg and/or nixpkgs-update significantly, leading to faster Nixpkgs PR automation and CI velocity.

mentor-guide.md,"Testing and enhancing Dynamic Derivations
Existing work on an experimental feature known as ""dynamic derivations"", which refers to derivation outputs that can themselves be derivations, lacks the adequate testing to be upstreamed. Moreover, functionality can be added to this feature in order to enable ""lang2nix"" tools to act in a more seamless manner than they do now.
The goal of this project is thus to thoroughly test this feature, in addition to adding new functionalities to it. Such functionalities include but are not limited to :

Methods for converting foreign packages to Nix, such as with graphs for various package managers, we can also create conversion tools for Ninja and Make graphs. This could greatly benefit large builds like Chromium and LLVM.

Additionally, determine a path for upstream tools like CMake, Meson, etc., to integrate with Nix.

We can also explore modifying language-specific package managers to utilize Nix for the actual building process.

README.md,"Nixpkgs : Build GCC libraries and compiler separately
This project aims to redo the way we build GCC so it is the same as LLVM :
build libraries separately from compiler, let Nixpkgs control the bootstrapping.
Exherbo Linux builds GCC in this way, so there is precedent.
Doing this will enable major simplifications in bootstrapping, cross compiling, cc-wrapper, etc.
These benefits however are fine to leave until after the GSOC project ends.
This is a very advanced project because it requires building a very old convoluted project (GCC) in ways that the upstream project doesn't anticipate.
The ability to be self-motivated, researching obscure error messages that few other people have encountered before, and generally trace issues to their root causes is required.
Being able to read GCC's source code, and potentially create patches (in C, C++, etc.) and upstream them is also a useful skill.

Multi channel mixing support (STEMS),"Lately various AI driven algorithms have been published that are able to extract single instrument recordings (STEM) from an audio track file. Native Instruments has introduced an open definition for stem files STEMS to store these extracts. A Stem file contains the original a stereo track and four additional channel with the musical elements: A drums stem, a bassline stem, a melody stem and a vocal stem, in a m4a container. Currently Mixxx is only capable of playing the stereo track. The goal of this project is to extract all channels and allow the user to mix them individually. In a fist version the Stem mixer can replace the equalizer in the Mixxx GUI. In an advanced version an integration with effects system is desired.","['Good understanding of sound processing', ' C++']",Medium,175 h,Mixxx,https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/GSOC-2024-Ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/mixxx/ivlj1kl8jabpmfs9-360.png,5
AI driven STEMS analyzer,Currently creation of stem files files is a manual process in preparation of a DJ set. Many DJs can't effort the time and the storage space for extracting stem files. In this project a temporary stem file shall be created on demand from the Mixxx GUI. Part of the project shall be evaluation of already published algorithms. Integration of one of them into the Mixxx analyzer and handling of the caching an the required GUI for this feature.,"['Good understanding of sound processing', ' C++']",Medium,175 h,Mixxx,https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/GSOC-2024-Ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/mixxx/ivlj1kl8jabpmfs9-360.png,5
Turn table inertia model,Some Controller mappings have implemented a Spin-Up/Spin-Down to mimic the inertia of a turn table. This should be generalized into a 'turn table inertia model' that models all moving parts like the platter and the slip pad. Some DJ actions on the controller or keyboard should be applied to that model rather than directly to Mixxx transport unit. The transport is than controlled by the turn table model. This should make all transport effects/actions sound more natural. It allows Spin-Up/Spin-Down effects and keyboard/mouse scratching. Part of the project is to record the spin up of a real turn table to get to know of the real acceleration curve and model this via software.,"['Good understanding of sound processing', ' C++']",Medium,350 h,Mixxx,https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/GSOC-2024-Ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/mixxx/ivlj1kl8jabpmfs9-360.png,5
Scratch smoothing,"Our scratching algorithm suffers from jitter noise created by the latency of the midi messages. It also suffers from a so called sticker drift, an incrementing offset shifting away form the original scratch sample. Part of this project is to filter the discrete messages from the controller in a way that you can either 'play' the track without much wobbling by turning the jog wheel, and keep the position during scratching. We may also make use of the time stamps of the midi messages.","['Good understanding of real time processing', ' C++']",Hard,350 h,Mixxx,https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/GSOC-2024-Ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/mixxx/ivlj1kl8jabpmfs9-360.png,5
Sharp Scratching,Currently crossfader changes are stretched on audio buffer time to avoid pop sounds. This is too long for some scratching styles. During this project you need to dive into the audio engine code find the code that is responsible for crossfading and make it independent from the audio buffer size.,"['Good understanding of sound processing', ' C++']",Medium,175 h,Mixxx,https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/GSOC-2024-Ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/mixxx/ivlj1kl8jabpmfs9-360.png,5
Resample options,"Mixxx uses a linear resample when scratching. This is blazing fast, but the sound can be improved. Here Mixxx should provide more resample options. This project involves to review the already used resample libraries RubberBand and Soundtouch and compare them with other candidates. The one with the best Sound/CPU load trade of shall be selected. Make sure that it supports on the fly changing of the sample rate without artefacts. This project may also involve to contribute a missing feature to such library.","['Good understanding of sound processing', ' C++']",Easy,175 h,Mixxx,https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/GSOC-2024-Ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/mixxx/ivlj1kl8jabpmfs9-360.png,5
Graceful recovery of controllers,"If a controller is accidentally unplugged it has to be manually reconfigured, which is a party stopper. Mixxx shall do it automatically. This project has two stages, fist behave like a real DJ: fix the issue but faster. So the the time of silence on the dance floor is kept short. The advance stage of this project is to implement real Hot Plug And Play. Here you shall evaluate alternative midi libraries like libremidi.

First class Pipewire support,Currently Mixxx supports Pipewire via Portaudio and Jack. These two glue layers leads to a limited feature support with a weak user experience. In this project you need to consider solutions to improve the situation.

Track encoding offset correction,"Different codecs used to encode sound files introduce slight shift in the audio samples comparing the input with the output stream. This is no issue when you use always the same file and the same decoder. It becomes however an issue when the decoder is updated or replaced because than all stored metadata like waveform, beat-grids and cue points are no longer at the correct position. To protect against surprises Mixxx has unit-tests to verify that seeks inside that track do not introduce an offset and checks if the fist sound sample can be found at the expected time.

Crosswords: Port libipuz to rust,"Libipuz is a C library that loads puzzle files and used by Crosswords as the underlying data structure. It is written in C. Since it is used primarily to parse files from disk, rewriting it in Rust adds additional safety while (hopefully) improving the maintainability of this library.","['Rust', ' C Language', ' glib']",Medium,~175 hours,GNOME Foundation,https://gsoc.gnome.org/2024,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/gnome-foundation/aqwqx1x6ozjnxsak-360.png,10
More durable synching for FlatSync,"FlatSync is a GSoC 2023 project to synchronise Flatpak installations across machines. During GSoC 2023 FlatSync was bootstrapped and already has basic synchronisation functionality. However, there are still some missing pieces: Currently FlatSync stubbornly tries to synchronise all Flatpaks. This doesn't make sense in all cases, e.g. if you only want NVidia drivers to be installed on your desktop machine but not your laptop (which only has an internal GPU). Instead, we should add a way to exclude some flatpaks/do machine specific overrides. The error handling is still pretty basic and users aren't notified about failed synchs. The UI is currently very basic, only allowing users to enter their GitHub-Token. During GSoC 2024, the following things should be added: An initial setup, which guides the user how to add an initial/additional machine A UI to exclude certain flatpaks (see above) Having these capabilities would make FlatSync viable for GNOME users, making Flatpaks a lot nicer to use for GNOME users with multiple computers.","['Rust', ' GTK-rs']",Medium,~175 hours,GNOME Foundation,https://gsoc.gnome.org/2024,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/gnome-foundation/aqwqx1x6ozjnxsak-360.png,10
Add support for the latest GIR attributes and gi-docgen formatting to Valadoc,"Valadoc is the API documentation generator for the Vala programming language. First it is needed to make the Vala API generator and Vala compiler support the latest GObject-Introspection attributes to for example marking a method as getter or setter of a property and emit them (issue). This will also benefit other users of Vala libraries, like language bindings. Then in Valadoc would be support implemented for displaying these attributes and information properly. Other not directly involved but connected things to work on would be to add support to Valadoc for understanding the formatting of gi-docgen API references (issue) and modernizing the style of the outputted documentation pages bit (issue).","['Vala', ' compilers', ' GObject type system']",Medium,~90 hours,GNOME Foundation,https://gsoc.gnome.org/2024,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/gnome-foundation/aqwqx1x6ozjnxsak-360.png,9
Rework Bustle's Diagram,"Currently, Bustle's diagram has a few design problems. This includes, but not limited to: Unreadable arrows on concurrent method calls between two services; Time is not represented well, i.e., longer method calls are not really represented by a longer gap between rows; and RTL is not supported well. The goal of the project is to, therefore, prototype a new design, possibly an overhaul, that solves the aforementioned problems, weigh its pros and cons, and implement it into the application. The old and new diagram view can coexist by creating a view switcher. The project would benefit the community as it would improve Bustle's functionality and usability in debugging DBus applications.

Improve Workbench previewer,"Workbench grew from a simple GTK XML previewer to a multi-language code sandbox. Some of the early technical decisions do not make sense anymore, and we can improve Workbench as well as extend the ecosystem by reworking some of the internals. Add an out-of-process previewer for JavaScript, similar to Python Remove the inline previewer for JavaScript Stop listening on stdout for console Write a previewer as an introspectable library Replace the previewers with the unified library If time permits, we will investigate using the previewer for a GNOME Builder extension.","['JavaScript', ' C', ' GObject', ' GTK']",Hard,~350 hours,GNOME Foundation,https://gsoc.gnome.org/2024,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/gnome-foundation/aqwqx1x6ozjnxsak-360.png,10
Small screen and refined touch support for Papers,"The goal of the project is to make Papers useful on devices like phones and tablets. It is unfortunately one of the few (soon to be) Core Apps which does not properly fit in a phone form factor or with not good enough touch support. The project includes two parts, out of which the second could be optional: The compulsory one is changing the UI to use a more adaptive design according to latest mockups, the main skills required are widgetry knowledge. The optional part is doing changes at the core of one of the application's libraries to consider touch support. The said library has many years of life, and some of its components are outdated and in need of refactoring. So the ability to understand other people's code and dig into git history should greatly help. Component: Papers","['C', ' Rust', ' git']",Medium,~175 hours (could be more if it also includes touch support),GNOME Foundation,https://gsoc.gnome.org/2024,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/gnome-foundation/aqwqx1x6ozjnxsak-360.png,60
Idea 1: Video Evidence (Video recording of tests),"While Nightwatch.js currently offers an integrated HTML reporter which helps aggregate and visualize the test results, along with HTML snapshots of the website state at the point of test failure, it has been a long-standing request from the community to add support for providing complete video recordings of the test runs as well, in case of test failure.","['JavaScript', ' Node.js', ' ReactJS (for HTML Reporter)']",Medium,350 hours,Nightwatch.js,https://github.com/nightwatchjs/mentorship/blob/main/google-summer-of-code/GSoC-2024-Ideas.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/nightwatchjs/slpwnkwtngatafl1-360.png,9
Idea 2: Add improvements to @nightwatch/mobile-helper tool,"@nightwatch/mobile-helper is a tool that allows developers and testers to set up a fully functional Android Emulator environment in just a few minutes, without the need to download the complete Android Studio IDE software. This tool comes in very handy while setting up Android Emulators for end-to-end web or native app testing so that the testers can go from nothing to running their first test on an Android Emulator in under 3 minutes. Additionally, this tool can also be used by other users for setting up Android Emulator environments.","['JavaScript', ' Android SDK', ' Android Virtual Devices (AVDs)']",Medium,,Nightwatch.js,https://github.com/nightwatchjs/mentorship/blob/main/google-summer-of-code/GSoC-2024-Ideas.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/nightwatchjs/slpwnkwtngatafl1-360.png,3

Fuzzer,"This project aims to develop or integrate a fuzzer for bpftime, using tools like Google's Buzzer or syzkaller. The fuzzer will systematically test bpftime to uncover any potential bugs, memory leaks, or vulnerabilities, ensuring a more secure and stable runtime environment. Besides, we also need to add kernel eBPF test for bpftime to improve compatibility.

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024,"The SPCL group applied as an organization to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program for our open-source projects in data-centric programming and serverless computing. You can find here student project proposals, advice on applying, and introductions to each project to start using our software. Learn more on how to apply and write your proposal from the contributor guideline. You will also find there the proposal template. Get in touch with mentors and discuss the project ideas using the provided email address and reach out to them on our Mattermost server - join the public Google Summer of Code channel. Our project ideas are grouped into two categories: serverless computing and data-centric programming framework. Serverless: At SPCL, we develop several open-source projects that target Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), a new cloud paradigm concerned with writing stateless and serverless functions. Our benchmarking suite SeBS provides automatic build, deployment, and invocations of representative serverless functions on several commercial and open-source FaaS platforms. We published and develop a serverless ZooKeeper implementation FaaSKeeper, a high-performance and RDMA-based serverless platform rFaaS, and a serverless collectives library FMI for parallel and distributed applications.","['Python', ' Docker', ' cloud experience', ' Node.js']",Easy/Medium,"90 hours (small) or 175 hours (medium), depending on the project scope",Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory,https://github.com/spcl/.github/blob/main/profile/gsoc.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/scalable-parallel-computing-laboratory/cho0tqlhmykehqlw-360.png,70
[SeBS] Keeping up with clouds,"In SeBS, we support AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, and OpenWhisk. Since the original release of SeBS, we have seen a lot of changes: growing popularity of ARM functions on AWS, new Azure Functions runtime versions, Google Cloud Functions version 2, and Knative becoming one of the most popular open-source serverless platforms. Adding support for new runtimes and platforms would help SeBS stay usable and competitive in the changing world of clouds.","['Python', ' Docker']",Easy/Medium,"175 hours (medium) or 350 hours (large), depending on the project scope",Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory,https://github.com/spcl/.github/blob/main/profile/gsoc.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/scalable-parallel-computing-laboratory/cho0tqlhmykehqlw-360.png,71
[SeBS] New serverless benchmarks,"In SeBS, we provide a representative set of functions, and we have developed a set of serverless workflows that will be included in the upcoming release. However, the serverless field is constantly changing, and new types of applications are being 'FaaS-ified'. Therefore, we would like to extend our benchmarking suite with new function candidates, such as utility functions (PDF generation, antivirus scanning) or scientific benchmarks, new invocation types (functions invoked on changes in object storage), and new workflows.","['Python', ' Docker']",Easy/Medium,"175 hours (medium) or 350 hours (large), depending on the project scope (number of benchmarks)",Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory,https://github.com/spcl/.github/blob/main/profile/gsoc.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/scalable-parallel-computing-laboratory/cho0tqlhmykehqlw-360.png,94
[SeBS] New performance experiments,"SeBS includes automatic experiments that evaluate specific performance features of serverless platforms, such as latency and cost of function invocations or invocation overheads. The goal of the project would be to add new experiments that use microbenchmarks and serverless functions to evaluate interesting metrics and characteristics of a serverless runtime. An example would be a flexible and configurable workload generator, based on JMeter or a similar system, to measure throughput, scalability, and the elasticity of the platform when varying workloads. Another goal would be to extend existing trigger types with storage and queues to understand the latency and throughput of synchronous and asynchronous invocations and measure the latency of pipeline invocations. Do you have another idea for an interesting experiment? Let us know!",['Python'],Medium/Difficult,"175 hours (medium) or 350 hours (large), depending on the project scope (number and scope of experiments)",Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory,https://github.com/spcl/.github/blob/main/profile/gsoc.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/scalable-parallel-computing-laboratory/cho0tqlhmykehqlw-360.png,105
[SeBS] Benchmarking serverless applications,"In SeBS, we focus on serverless functions and workflows. However, serverless is a rapidly changing field, and a new trend is building entire applications from serverless functions. These include, for example, using various cloud triggers to compose functions and porting microservice benchmarks to serverless. Users of SeBS would greatly benefit from being able to benchmark such complex applications and understand the performance bottlenecks of FaaS platforms. Based on existing open-source implementations, one should propose representative applications covering new, exciting use cases of serverless.","['Python', ' Docker', ' C++/Go', ' cloud experience']",Medium/Difficult,350 hours (large),Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory,https://github.com/spcl/.github/blob/main/profile/gsoc.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/scalable-parallel-computing-laboratory/cho0tqlhmykehqlw-360.png,17
[rFaaS] Serverless MPI functions,"The HPC community has been working on supporting malleable and evolving applications in MPI, i.e., applications that require dynamic adjusting of the number of workers. Examples include Flex-MPI and invasive MPI. Serverless functions could be a perfect runtime for such a task - they can be allocated and removed on-the-fly, aiding the elasticity of MPI applications. However, MPI runtimes are tightly coupled with batch systems, and reimplementing the MPI interface with a new serverless-aware library would prevent us from using optimized communication methods. Instead, in this project, we want to investigate an alternative approach - analyze the process runtime of an open-source MPI implementation, such as the PMI component of OpenMPI. We want to replace the process management with an experimental prototype that will allocate MPI processes as rFaaS functions. With initialized processes and communication, functions can execute MPI code and benefit from tuned implementations of MPI collectives.","['C++', ' HPC', ' OpenMPI/MPICH internals']",Difficult,350 hours (large),Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory,https://github.com/spcl/.github/blob/main/profile/gsoc.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/scalable-parallel-computing-laboratory/cho0tqlhmykehqlw-360.png,17
[FaaSKeeper] Using serverless ZooKeeper in Apache projects,"FaaSKeeper implements standard ZooKeeper functionalities and includes a new client for Python applications. ZooKeeper has been used by many Java and Scala applications in the Apache project, e.g., Kafka and HBase. Since they use a limited set of features that might be covered by FaaSKeeper, demonstrating the integration of our function-based implementation would be a significant improvement to the project. The goal of the project would be to identify a relevant project(s) that could use FaaSKeeper instead of ZooKeeper, define the set of API calls that have to be implemented, and propose a new Java client library that offloads ZooKeeper calls to the REST cloud API instead of using ZooKeeper protocol.","['Python', ' Java', ' ZooKeeper']",Medium/Difficult,350 hours (large),Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory,https://github.com/spcl/.github/blob/main/profile/gsoc.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/scalable-parallel-computing-laboratory/cho0tqlhmykehqlw-360.png,17
[FMI] Optimized and multi-cloud serverless collectives,"FMI brings collective operations and point-to-point communication to serverless functions, using cloud storage and TCP connections with NAT hole punching. However, the primary implementation of FMI targets the AWS cloud. The first goal of the project would be porting to a new cloud, such as Google Cloud Functions. The second goal would be optimizing communication. For example, multi-core functions on AWS Lambda allow for the execution of multiple function workers as threads. There, we can use the local shared memory environment for communication. Another example would be implementing variants of standard and proven collective communication algorithms that target communication on very small (latency-bound) and very-large messages (bandwidth-bound).","['Python', ' cloud experience', ' C++/Go']",Medium/Difficult,350 hours (large),Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory,https://github.com/spcl/.github/blob/main/profile/gsoc.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/scalable-parallel-computing-laboratory/cho0tqlhmykehqlw-360.png,17

Implementing selected optimizations,"At SPCL , we develop a programming framework that is geared towards optimizing the data movement behavior of applications , a factor that limits the performance and efficiency of many large , real-world applications.
DaCe , or the Data-Centric Parallel Programming Framework , takes code written in Python and other programming languages , and translates it to highly optimized CPU , GPU , or FPGA programs through the use of a graphical intermediate program representation.

Data-Centric Programming,"High-performance programs can be represented as parametric graphs when using Data-Centric Parallel Programming . These graphs have a hierarchical structure , whereby control flow graphs are used to express control flow over parts of the application , and inside each basic block of a control flow graph a data flow graph represents the movement of data through an application . These graphs , also called SDFGs , can become very large and hard to read for bigger and more complex applications . Oftentimes an engineer may consequently prefer navigating the original source code , because they have additional meta information that tells them about a program ’ s behavior such as function or file names . This kind of information is naturally abstracted away in a representation such as SDFGs . In this project you will work on implementing named control flow groups or regions that can be used to carry over some of the information from source code representations into the SDFG representation . By annotating an SDFG with more source code information such as function or procedure names , an engineer can obtain more contextual clues while navigating a program ’ s data flow graph which can drastically help their optimization or problem solving efforts.","['Python ', ' Javscript/Typescript ', ' basic understanding of graph theory']",Difficult,Large ( 350 hours ),Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory,https://github.com/spcl/.github/blob/main/profile/gsoc.md,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/scalable-parallel-computing-laboratory/cho0tqlhmykehqlw-360.png,19

The project will be divided into two main parts: Research of existing solutions and/or data collection Integration of the ML classifier into TANNER Over the past few years, we have collected data from various SNARE sensors. This data is annotated using regular expressions and can be used for building a data-driven classification model of web-based attacks. However, since this data is noisy and imbalanced, it requires careful pre-processing and filtering. Moreover, curating the test set is essential to build a robust, high-quality model. External datasets can be used along with historical data from TANNER to enlarge the dataset and mitigate the noise. The resulting ML model must have accuracy above the regexp baseline and low latency to enable real-time analysis of the TANNER events.

IntelChat: Enhancing Threat Analysis with an LLM-Based Chatbot in IntelOwl,"The proposed Google Summer of Code project aims to integrate a cutting-edge, self-deployed LLM-based chatbot into IntelOwl, enhancing user interaction with collected threat intelligence. Leveraging Python libraries like LangChain and ChainLit, the project envisions building an intuitive interface that empowers analysts to pose natural language queries about threat data, fostering a more user-friendly and efficient investigative process (e.g. “In what campaigns have you seen this IOC?”) The chatbot’s capabilities will extend beyond basic queries, seamlessly interfacing with IntelOwl’s enrichment modules when deeper investigation is required, providing a comprehensive and interactive experience for analysts. By harnessing the power of LLM technology, the chatbot will not only streamline communication between analysts and the IntelOwl platform but also adapt to evolving user needs, contributing to a more dynamic and responsive threat intelligence environment. This project aligns with the overarching goal of making threat analysis more accessible and efficient, offering analysts a powerful tool that combines the strengths of natural language understanding, self-deployment, and seamless integration with IntelOwl’s existing modules.","['Python', ' Natural Language Processing', ' Threat Analysis']",Hard,350,The Honeynet Project,https://www.honeynet.org/gsoc/gsoc-2024/google-summer-of-code-2024-project-ideas/,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/the-honeynet-project/pvycoc21p2ketj7b-360.png,3

a prefix ( or list of prefixes or an ASN ) from a user , optionnally the user can
select a list of RIS collectors and the maximum number of hops from the monitored
prefix to display . Then the user push a 'play ' button . The tool connects to
RIS Live with the corresponding parameters and displays the AS paths received.
It could be similar to BGPlay but we 'd like to
show only nodes that are near the monitored prefix so the graphs are more readable.

Network topology overview,"IHR monitors the inter-dependence of networks ( e.g . the
university of Tokyo relies on Japan 's academic ISP ) and displays these
dependencies with very simple line charts that highlights changes over time.
Representing this data as a graph is more intuitive for network operators.
So the goal of this project is to show the connectivity of a network ( aka AS ) in
a simple graph.
Using data from the Internet Yellow Pages we can depict a very detailed view of
an AS , by finding all prefixes originated by the AS , fetching AS dependencies for
all these prefixes , grouping these prefixes based on their dependencies , and
finally displaying an AS graph that shows how these prefixes are connected to the
Internet . Additional information for each AS/prefix can be displayed by querying
IYP.
Related to this project , we have an offline tool that shows network dependencies
for a country , this is also something we 'd like to implement on IHR website

Existing code downscales the low-frequency (monthly to annual) carbon pool outputs using a random forest model and a harmonized stack of gridded spatial data (climate, land use/land cover, soils, topography). The current system also preserves the covariance structure across variables, space, and time by downscaling each model ensemble member separately and then using the downscaled ensemble to calculate summary statistics.

Adopting data schema for field management events,"This project aims to adapt a data schema for an R shiny application called fieldactivity. Fieldactivity is an application that allows field operators and researchers to enter field information about management activities through UI to aid bookkeeping of such events. The management activities and associated information are then stored in json files from which the information can be used for modelling. The fieldactivity application uses UI elements that are created with RShiny and therefore follows the R coding conventions. At the moment, to meet these R coding criteria, the data structure is read from a json file called ui_structure_json, which contains the necessary attributes to create the UI with R. As this json file is independent and does not communicate with any other data sources, it must be manually updated if the data requirements are to be kept up to date with other data sources. To overcome the potential differences between the data sources, we have created a json data schema (https://github.com/hamk-uas/fieldobservatory-data-schemas/blob/main/management-event.schema.json) to act as a single source of truth for different data sources. The GSoC task is to incorporate this schema into the fieldactivity shiny app such that it can read the variable information from the schema and store the data in the correct structure. In addition, the app should be made flexible such that when a change is made to the json schema, it can deploy and change/create UI elements accordingly on the fly. To achieve this, the functionalities around how the applications store the data need to be reconstructed.","['R and RShiny', ' json']",Medium,Flexible to work as either a Small (175hr) or Large (350 hr),PEcAn Project,https://pecanproject.github.io/gsoc_ideas.html,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/pecan-project/kijyzllr7r1g0ukz-360.png,60
PEcAn Code Hardening by Integration Testing,"The proposed project aims to enhance the reliability of PEcAn's integration tests by prioritizing packages associated with overall workflow bottlenecks. The focus will be on preparing contributors to gain an in-depth understanding of PEcAn's inner workings and the interactions between modules. It will commence with prioritizing basic runs to establish a robust foundation that include single site, single model runs to cover the major models. Subsequently, attention will shift towards ensemble runs, diversifying testing scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage. A specific emphasis will be placed on Data Simulation models for single site, single model runs, with a focus on prominent models. This initiative aims to provide contributors with a holistic perspective on PEcAn's functionality, fostering a deeper understanding of how individual modules contribute to the overall workflow. By combining these elements, the GSoC project seeks to create a structured and immersive learning experience that equips participants to contribute effectively to PEcAn's development while addressing critical workflow bottlenecks.",['R'],Medium,Flexible to work as either a Small (175hr) or Large (350 hr),PEcAn Project,https://pecanproject.github.io/gsoc_ideas.html,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/pecan-project/kijyzllr7r1g0ukz-360.png,60
Optimize PEcAn for freestanding use of single packages [R package development],"PEcAn was designed as a system of independent modules, each implemented as its own R package that was intended to be usable either standalone or as part of the full PEcAn system. Subsequent development focused on the most common cross-module workflows has lead to tighter coupling between modules than was originally intended, so that in practice many of the modules are now challenging to use, test, or develop without a full understanding of their interdependencies. Further, some packages expect inputs and outputs in data structures that are only generated by other PEcAn packages but might be more easily provided in standard well-known formats. We seek proposals to re-loosen these couplings by revisiting the design and interface of PEcAn packages through one or more of: Refactoring code to remove unneeded dependencies, simplify package interfaces, and exchange data in standard formats Identifying exported functions that are not core to the functionality of the package, and removing them or making them internal Writing tests and examples that demonstrate freestanding use of the package Developing methods for tracking the dependencies between packages that cannot be eliminated, including how these change between package versions Proposals for this project should choose a subset of these approaches and apply them to a specified subset of the PEcAn packages.

PEcAn in the clouds,"The PEcAn system is a complex system with many microservices such as the database system, frontend, models, job management etc. These microservices lend themselves to be deployed in the cloud. We have an existing helm chart that should get you most of the way there and should allow you to deploy pecan on kubernetes. Additionally, there is a docker-compose file that should allow you to deploy PEcAn on a single server using docker. This project will take the helm chart and docker-compose files and harden them and upgrade them to use the latest versions of containers. The current system uses the shared folder not only to deploy data in all services but also uses it to let the central system know when executions are finished. We would like to move away from this shared system and use the message system to indicate executions are done, and use a file service to pull and push data (for example from/to S3).","['Familiarity with Kubernetes', ' Docker', ' Helm and R.

Version Constraint Resolution (fpm),"The current decentralized package system in fpm allows dependencies to be fetched via a git repository URL. As part of this, a git tag or commit can be given to require a specific version of a dependency. There is however no way of specifying version compatibility requirements (e.g. >= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0) and no way to resolve such requirements across a dependency tree. This project will involve: Defining a manifest syntax for version compatibility matching Implementing support in fpm for solving a set of version compatibility constraints A possible approach would be to interface with an existing satisfiability solver such as: libsolv: interface via iso_c_binding as a separate fpm package See also: existing options for version matching syntax: conda npm cargo Expected outcomes: Implemented a working version constraint mechanism in fpm","['Fortran programming', ' experience with one or more build systems']",Intermediate,350 hours,Fortran-lang,https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage/wiki/GSoC-2024-Project-ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/fortran-lang/ay9se7mc6vgdwgbn-360.png,9
Build Process Enhancements (fpm),"Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is pivotal for long-term Fortran success. This GSoC project aims to improve fpm’s build process by improving dependency detection, optimizing linking, implementing shared libraries, ensuring safe concurrent builds, and introducing external Makefile generation. The project will address the following tasks: Dependency Detection: Enhance fpm’s dependency detection to minimize rebuilds by parsing or hashing module/submodule files or parsing procedure interfaces in module files. fpm should not rebuild dependencies to a module whose public interface has not changed. Linking Optimization: Replace one-liner linking with static libraries to prevent line buffer overflow in Windows builds. Shared Library Implementation: Introduce support for shared library targets for project flexibility. Safe Concurrent Builds: Implement file locking for safe concurrent invocations, especially during OpenMP builds, to prevent data corruption. External Makefile Generation: Enable generation of external Makefiles akin to cmake -G for advanced project configuration. Expected Outcomes: Enhanced dependency tracking and reduced rebuild times. Improved reliability in linking, particularly in Windows. Increased project versatility with shared library support. Safer concurrent builds through file locking. Greater project configuration flexibility with external Makefile generation.","['Fortran programming', ' experience with one or more build systems']",Intermediate,175 hours,Fortran-lang,https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage/wiki/GSoC-2024-Project-ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/fortran-lang/ay9se7mc6vgdwgbn-360.png,9
Extended Testing Support (fpm),"The aim of this project is to create a manifest specification to provide defaults to executable targets in fpm projects. Information can be passed as environment variables, command-line arguments or as a runner. Desired features include: Programs should have a way to find resources of which the relative position within the project source directory is known. The current binary directory to access other targets within a project. Default runners like mpirun/cafrun or scripts from test frameworks should be usable to launch programs. A general syntax to define environment variables and command-line arguments should be defined. Some features should be implemented directly in fpm, while more elaborated functionality could be implemented in a separate fpm package as an official Fortran-lang fpm package.

Export build order and compile_commands.json (fpm),fpm has the ability to automatically determine the build order of a project's source files. This information is valuable to third party tools such as language servers and code analysis tools. The goal of this project is to export the build order of a project's source files in the compile_commands.json. The second leg of this project is to implement the full syntax of compile_commands.json as described in the Clang documentation. This would bring fpm a step closer to being compatible with other build tools.

Support of external third-party preprocessors,"Adding support for external third-party preprocessors is important for fpm due to the additional flexibility they provide when building complex packages. In particular, the Fortran-lang stdlib project exploits the powerful fypp preprocessor for code generation and the support of fypp by fpm is required for stdlib to eventually be compatible as an fpm package. This project will require to: Modify fpm to optionally invoke a third-party preprocessor before compiling sources; Extend the current manifest syntax of fpm for defining preprocessor variables in a preprocessor-independent manner, if necessary; Extend the current manifest syntax of fpm for specifying a third-party preprocessor and the corresponding file suffixes, if necessary; Passe defined preprocessor variables to built-in preprocessors if necessary; Third-party preprocessors should be specified on a per-project basis, i.e. multiple preprocessors might be required, and fpm should be able to report useful errors for missing third-party preprocessors. Expected outcomes: fpm has a working preprocessing capability","['Fortran', ' C', ' or Python programming', ' experience using one or more preprocessors']",Easy,175 hours,Fortran-lang,https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage/wiki/GSoC-2024-Project-ideas,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/media/org/fortran-lang/ay9se7mc6vgdwgbn-360.png,9
